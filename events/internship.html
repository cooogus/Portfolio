          <div class="prose">
            <p>This summer I had the pleasure to intern at the startup AI chip company Tensordyne. I spent three months trying 
                to learn as much as I could, get to know as many talented people as possible, and find my new favorite places to 
                eat in the Bay Area. 
            </p>
            <p>Going in, I was honestly a bit nervous. It was my first foray into the industry side of the tech world and I didn't want to fall
                into the common intern trap of learning a lot but not really helping the company out. I wanted to be able 
                to have a lasting influence, to be able to point to something after I was gone and say: "Hey I made that and
                they use it still!"
            </p>
            <p>
                Spending this summer immersed in this company has ended up giving me more than I could have
                ever possibly hoped for. Not only was I able to create a bunch of new stuff that taught me new things 
                (check my projects page for more info)
                and helped out this extremely innovative company, but I also got to meet and befriend a bunch of extremely 
                talented individuals, each with their own story about how they ended up here. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I got to see the inner workings of this company as they went through an entire rebrand, and office move, to start 
                prepping for product release at the end of next year. I was not only relegated to interacting with the
                software team, but I spoke with people on the ASIC, board design, marketing, and product teams. I learned 
                about what actually goes into making an idea into a company and also just how important those people 
                behind the scenes, like office managers, are. Without our office manager we wouldn't have been lucky 
                enough to have lunch waiting for us everyday! 
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned about what an actual software engineering role entails, because despite what many may think, 
                you are not in fact just coding for 8 hours straight, 5 days a week. Some days may be like that, but more
                often than not you are in constant collaboration with your teammates when faced with bugs, design choices, etc.
                I also learned how to navigate having an office across the pond in Munich, Germany and was amazed with how seamless
                Tensordyne was able to navigate this despite being a smaller company. Seeing the team in Sunnyvale wake up 
                a little earlier some days for meetings with the German team, and the German team being available sometimes way 
                late into the evening on their side, was honestly inspiring. Not often do you get to work in a team where everyone
                is clearly so passionate about what they're doing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As I reflect, I am immensely grateful for the opportunity I was given to spend my summer here. I have met people who I
                hope to stay in contact with in the future, and who I would call not only coworkers, but friends as well. That's the 
                environment they have at Tensordyne and I hope they continue to grow, while still keeping this healthy startup vibe. I 
                truly believe in their hardware, and after collaborating to their SDK a bit, I believe they're also going to have the software
                to back it up.
